## Parent Task

This project is created using laravel sail

- Run sail composer update
- Run sail up
- The repository containing the logic =>  /App/Repositories/Eloquent/ProviderRepository.php
- The json files is located at => storage/app/public
- Api request docs => https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2535192/UVsEV8nQ

## How it work

In the storage/app/public you will find a file called providers config.json it's a list of the providers with their corresponding keys in each provider file.
After adding the new provider object in the config file
you just add the provider file that contains the users data in the storage/app/public folder

And that's it you just added new provider.

Thanks
